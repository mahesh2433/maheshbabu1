        <p>The study presents initial estimates of the expected health gains from reduced diarrhoeal disease and malnutrition due to increased sanitation coverage following the Swachh Bharat initiative and was undertaken at the request of the Ministry of
            Drinking Water and Sanitation. The Swachh Bharat Mission marks a paradigm shift in India's approach to sanitation. It goes beyond the traditional understanding of sanitation as merely the construction of toilets and encompasses a holistic
            perspective that includes behaviour change, waste management, and awareness creation.
