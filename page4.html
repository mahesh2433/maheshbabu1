                all age groups. By using vibrant colors and clear typography, design captures attention and encourages positive behavior changes. Whether it's posters, social media graphics, or educational materials, design is a powerful tool in promoting
                health and hygiene practices.<br>
                <i style="color: #4caf50;">Visuals amplify awareness through clarity and impact.</i>

            <p>
                Community engagement is vital for the success of health and hygiene initiatives. Local events, workshops, and clean-up drives foster a sense of ownership and responsibility among citizens. By involving schools, NGOs, and local governments, communities
                can work together to create lasting change. Engaging with the community not only raises awareness but also builds a culture of cleanliness and hygiene that can be passed down through generations.<br>
                <i style="color: #4caf50;">Together, we can build a cleaner, healthier future.</i>
