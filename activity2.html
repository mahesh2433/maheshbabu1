        <p>The face mask has become one of the essential accessories as they are used as the most efficient strategy of precautionary measures to curb covid-19 transmission. Last year, many people thought it would be a temporary phase and won't have to wear
            face masks after things get better. But little did they know that they would have to wear masks as they wear clothes every day. Face masks have mandatory become a necessity, and maintaining the hygiene of the face masks has also become equally
            important for health. </p><br>
